The conventional ELK stack without sharding did not scale for the quantity of logs at GO-JEK’s scale, and maintaining individual ELK clusters became unsustainable. Proper logging is critical for system visibility and identifying issues, which directly improves Mean Time To Respond (MTTR). While the context doesn't explicitly detail how BARITO improves security, the enhanced logging capabilities provide visibility crucial for identifying and addressing security incidents. GoPay, as part of GoTo Financial, also faces the challenge of serving a large unbanked population, and improved logging infrastructure likely supports the security and reliability of its services."
