However, being fast was not the only\nrequirement, they also needed to build scalable and reliable systems.\nAddressing these technical issues, Giri shared that the team adopted modern\ncloud native technologies that could address the issues at scale, such as\nmicroservices, containers, Kubernetes and service mesh.\n“We did achieve the scale and reliability, but our infrastructure was becoming\nincreasingly more complex for developers who weren’t familiar with this\nlayer of technology, and ultimately slowed down our collective developer\nvelocity.”\nHe added that the cloud native adoption also required the developer teams to\nperform major infrastructure migration — multiple times. “Developers who\nwere supposed to deliver features to end customers had to deal with these\nunnecessary tasks. [...] When developers were not able to spend most of their\ntime writing codes for customers, it did not just affect their productivity but\nalso morale. Because they believed in tech for good, in making a lasting\nimpact on people.”\nGiovanni further stated that the risk of the company’s exponential growth\nwas that each of the tech leads would make decisions in silo. “With rapid\ngrowth, requirements pour in, so each tech lead would have to make decisions\non their own,” he said.\n\uf1e0\n\uf39e \uf099 \uf0e1\nGoPay.sh: A glimpse into Indonesia’s leading e-wallet GoPay’s Develo... https://www.thejakartapost.com/adv-longform/2022/06/16/gopay-sh-a-...\n2 of 5 20/11/25, 14.28', '<3-hop>\n\nGoPay, as part of Indonesia’s tech giant GoTo’s fintech provider GoTo\nFinancial, seeks to tackle this issue with technology.\nHowever, helping Indonesia’s population of 270 million to unlock their\nfinancial potential is not an easy task.

This complexity arose from the ecosystem’s growth, creating technical and managerial challenges for developers. The team adopted modern cloud native technologies like microservices, containers, Kubernetes, and service mesh to achieve scale and reliability. However, this also made the infrastructure more complex for developers unfamiliar with these technologies, slowing down their velocity. Ultimately, the goal was to allow developers to focus on writing code for customers rather than infrastructure tasks."

Each team has their own ELK cluster, but\nmaintaining ELK clusters while everyone in the team has other pressing\nresponsibilities is becoming a luxury we can’t afford. Another problem is that\nsome of the teams grow too fast and the ELK became inadequate and\noverwhelming to support enormous amount of logs.\nAccess\nHow we built ‘BARITO’ to enhance logging - 5 min read https://www.gojek.io/blog/how-we-built-barito-to-enhance-logging\n2 of 10 20/11/25, 10.27', '<2-hop>\n\nH Ho ow w  w we e  b bu ui il lt t  ‘ ‘B BA AR RI IT TO O’ ’  t to o  e en nh ha an nc ce e  l lo og gg gi in ng g\nBuilding a logging infrastructure commensurate to GO-JEK’s scale\n5 MIN READ  \xa0| \xa0 DEC 08, 2018 Share: \nBB yy   TT aa r r aa   BB aa s s kk aa r r aa\nImagine coming home from a tiring day of work and your white-fenced house is\nsuddenly pink.
